# C - More singly linked lists

According to [Techie Delight](https://www.techiedelight.com/introduction-linked-lists), A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a group of nodes where each node point to the next node through a pointer. Each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. Two important advantages of linked list over arrays are:

- The list elements can easily be be inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure
- Linked lists allow the insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list.

## Singly Linked List
Singly linked list contain nodes with a data field and a next field, which points to the next node in a line of nodes. The operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:

- insertion
- deletion
- traversal
