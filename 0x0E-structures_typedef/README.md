C - Structures, typedef

This is the 15th lesson, Structures and typedef in C. 

Strutures (struct)
A struct is a composite data type declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name which returns the same address.

typedef

typedef is a reserved keyword in the programming languages C and C++. It is used to create an additional name for another data type, but does not create a new type, except in the obscure case of a qualified typedef of an array type where the typedef qualifiers are transferred to the array element type.
